# HW3 Notetaking App

### James Edwards

This project holds a note taking app - you can create new notes, edit their contents, move them, and delete them. This was implemented with three components: an app, text bar, and notes. The logic was mostly clear although the new react syntax took some getting used to. One issue that I was unable to resolve was wrapping text when it went too far on each line - however, markdown is supported so this may help avoid that issue.
