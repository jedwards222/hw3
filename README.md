# HW3 Notetaking App

### James Edwards

This project holds a note taking app - you can create new notes, edit their contents, move them, and delete them. This was implemented with three components: an app, text bar, and notes. The logic was mostly clear although the new react syntax took some getting used to - one issue that I was unable to avoid was that newly created notes are added below where the previous note was created. This only really becomes an issue when you are making lots of notes and it becomes a nuisance to scroll down to the newest one.
